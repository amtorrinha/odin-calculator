# Calculator
This project consists of a page with a calculator with simple functionalities.
The calculator allows the user to add, subtract, multiply, divide and other minor features such as negative numbers, percentage, the use of the decimal point and the ability to clear the screen.

This work allowed me to write a complex JS script in terms of storing variables and using multiple functions to complete the calculator's operations. I also used relatively simple HTML elements (divs and buttons) and CSS styling to create a calculator, while interacting with the JS script by triggering events or changing the displayed text.
